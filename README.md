# Persistent Personalization Preferences

Keeps your personalization preferences persistant, just in case Windows try to change them on you.

## Overview

I like dark mode. Maybe you like light mode (no judgement). But Windows just cannot seem to remember that I selected Dark Mode, so occasionally it will change to Light Mode. (It seems to be related to Windwos Update, but happens other times randomly too.) That is where Persistent Personalization Preferences comes in. Just run it an select your personalization preferences and it makes them persistent.

# Persistent Personalization Preferences

Keeps your personalization preferences persistant, just in case Windows try to change them on you.

## Overview

I like dark mode. Maybe you like light mode (no judgement). But Windows just cannot seem to remember that I selected Dark Mode, so occasionally it will change to Light Mode. (It seems to be related to Windwos Update, but happens other times randomly too.) That is where Persistent Personalization Preferences comes in. Just run it an select your personalization preferences and it makes them persistent.

Then select your preferred theme

And lock it in

Select **Auto Start** and **Keep in Tray** and it will take care of things for you. Whenever Windows forgets and tries to blind you, it switches back immediately, sometimes even before you notice. 

You can even change your settings right from the system tray.

## Installation

There isn't an install, yet. Just [put the EXE](https://github.com/jimmckeeth/Persistent-Personalization-Preferences/releases/) where you want it and run it. When you select Auto Start it will remember it's location and run everytime you log into Windows.
